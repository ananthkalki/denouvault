## Problem Statement
In a crowded DeFi market, users are looking for an efficient, secure, and versatile decentralized exchange (DEX) to facilitate their transactions. Most existing DEXs suffer from high gas fees, slower transaction speeds, and liquidity issues. There is a clear need for a DEX that solves these problems while also offering concentrated liquidity features akin to Uniswap V3, but running on a more efficient blockchain like the XDC Chain.
